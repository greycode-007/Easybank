## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I decided to use just html and css is building this, the only Js in this project was the toggle the mobile navigation bar. 


```js
function toggleMobileMenu(menu) {
    menu.classList.toggle('open');
}

document.getElementsByClassName
document.getElementById("rounded").onclick = function() {
  
  document.getElementById("circle").style.display = "block";
}
```
